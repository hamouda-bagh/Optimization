# Optimization

Linear and non-linear optimization are useful methods to achieve objectives like maximizing and minimizing objective functions. After studying the theoretical concepts during the Optimization course at Tunisia Polytechnic School, we were asked to simulate some problems and find solutions in the numerical projects

TP 1 consists of dealing with unconstrained optimization problems, in which we use various gradient descent approaches.

In TP 2, we add constraints to the optimization problem and try to find the solution using more sophisticated approaches.
